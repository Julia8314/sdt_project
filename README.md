## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Streamlit web app** that provides an interactive exploration of car sales listings in the US. It allows users to:
- **View raw car listing data** with model years displayed as whole numbers.
- **Analyze price trends** using an interactive scatter plot.
- **Explore vehicle price and odometer distributions** through histograms.
- **Filter vintage cars** (manufactured before 1980) in the price distribution.

The app is built using **Python**, leveraging the following libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `streamlit` for the web interface
- `plotly.express` for interactive visualizations

## 🚀 Features
✔️ **Data Viewer**: Displays car listing data in an easy-to-read table.  
✔️ **Scatter Plot**: Shows the **average price vs. model year**, categorized by fuel type.  
✔️ **Histogram - Price Distribution**: Analyzes how car prices are distributed, with an option to filter **vintage cars** (pre-1980).  
✔️ **Histogram - Odometer Readings**: Shows how mileage is distributed across listings.
